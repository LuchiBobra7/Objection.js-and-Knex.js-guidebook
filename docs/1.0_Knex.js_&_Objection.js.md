# 1.0 Knex.js & Objection.js

**Knex.js** is the package that manages the connection between Node.JS and your SQL database. Knex.js provides a set of methods to execute CRUD operations on the database, which means you don't write actual SQL. 

Additionally to these methods, Knex.js comes with more tools like:
- **migrations** - makes your life more comfortable managing the tables of your SQL database. Migrations allow us to quickly alter a table after we have already created all the tables.
- **seeds** - helps you to populate the database with initial values. Usually, you'll need to seed your database to set some pre-defined values or for testing purposes.

**Objection.js** is an ORM and built upon Knex.js and allows us to define models for our SQL database. It also comes with build-in validation using a JSON schema you define for each model.


### Getting Started
A project which implements both packages should always start setting up Knex.js first and then Objection.js.
The database should have the tables and some data first before working with Objection.js.
