# 0.1 Project Setup
We first create a basic REST API using `Express`, before we start using the database, Knex.js, and Objection.js.

#### Setup
##### 1. Create a project directory
Create a project directory that you will work with

##### 2. Initialize the project
Run in your terminal
```shell
npm init -y
`"

##### 3. Install express
Express is a minimal, open-source, and flexible Node.js web app framework designed to make developing websites, web apps, & API's much easier.

Run in your terminal
```shell
npm install express --save
```

##### 4. Create the NodeJS server file
Create a file named `server.js`.

> **Note:**
> You can always run the app writing in your terminal `node server.js`, which starts the server.
> Alternatively, you can also use the [nodemon (Install guide here)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package to auto re-start the server on file change using the `nodemon server.js` command.
