# 2.1 Objection.js Models
The first thing we want to define is our models, which represent the tables in our SQL database.

You need to understand that Objection.js models are not creating the database table structure as used to with other languages and frameworks. Objection.js only task is to retrieve (called *getters*) from or update (called *setters*) to **existing tables**. Database table structures are handled by Knex.js migration files.

Objection.js provides many getter and setter methods.

The configuration of Objection.js happens through model classes, and there is no global configuration file (unlike the *knexfile.js* config file of Knex.js).

## Our first Model
We start by creating a working model with the minimum amount of code. Afterward, when we understand the basics, the code will be restructured and separated into their own files like **server.js**, **/models/User.js**, ... and so on.

Reuse the previously created **test.js** and insert the following code:
```js
// 1. Import and initialize Knex.js
const Knex = require("knex");
const knexFile = require("./knexfile.js");
const knex = Knex(knexFile.development);

// 2. Import Objection.js Model class
const { Model } = require("objection");

// 3. Bind all models to the knex instance
Model.knex(knex);

// 4. Create the User model class
class User extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return "users";
  }
}

// 5. Run the query in async/await
const getUsers = async () => {
  const users = await User.query();
  console.log(users);
};
getUsers();
```
**Output**
```shell
$ node test.js
[
  User { id: 1, name: 'Marc', age: 19 },
  User { id: 2, name: 'Ben', age: 31 },
  User { id: 3, name: 'Jessica', age: 27 }
]
```


**In the above code:**
1. Knex.js is initialized the same way as the **test.js** file of *Chapter 1.4 Knex.js Queries*
2. The Model class is imported from Objection.js
3. Bind all models to the knex instance
4. Create a minimal working `User` model class, which extends the `Model` object. The `static get tableName()` is one of many Objection.js native [static properties](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/model/static-properties.html) and is **required** for a model. 
`tableName()` returns the name `users`: the name of the database table we want our `User` class to model. This is the property that tells Objection.js during a query what table to query on. I.e., you don't specify table names during a query as previously seen in *Chapter 1.4 Knex.js Queries*.
5. Run the query in an async/await (or you could alternatively use `.then()` functions) because the query returns a promise.

## Restructuring our first Model
Now that we have the basic understanding of an Objection.js with Knex.js structure, we can split up the code, so it works in our initial project setup of NodeJS with Express.

### 1. Users Model
Each database table should have its own model, they should all live in a folder named `/models/` and the first character should be capital to indicate a class file.

Let's create the users model and add some code.

**/models/Users.js**
```js
// Include Model
const { Model } = require('objection');

// Step 4 from test.js moved here
class User extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'users';
  }
}

// Export User class
module.exports = User;
```

### 2. Include Knex.js and Objection.js in our project
**server.js** is our project configuration file but is currently missing Knex.js and Objection.js. Let us change that

**server.js**
```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const apiRoutes = require("./routes/api");

// Step 1 from test.js moved here
const Knex = require("knex");
const knexFile = require("./knexfile.js");
const knex = Knex(knexFile.development);

// Step 2 from test.js moved here
const { Model } = require("objection");

// Step 3 from test.js moved here
Model.knex(knex);

app.use("/api", apiRoutes);

const server = app.listen(8080, error => {
  if (error) {
    console.log("Error running Express");
  }
  console.log("Server is running on port", server.address().port);
});
```

### 3. Update the Express routes
Earlier on, the **/routes/api/users.js** file returned hardcoded data. Now that our project is hooked up to Objection.js and Knex.js can we return data directly from our SQL database.

```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const User = require("../../models/Users.s"); // Extra: Import the User

router.get("/", async (req, res) => { // Extra: add async to the function
  
  // Step 5 from test.js moved here
  const users = await User.query();
  res.json(users);


  // The old response
  /* 
  res.json([
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Marc",
      age: 19
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: "Ben",
      age: 31
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      name: "Jessica",
      age: 27
    }
  ]);
*/
});

module.exports = router;
```
Ensure that you import the User model and that the anonymous `(req,res) => { ... }` recieves the `async` keyword.

#### Todo model
So far we have a working project that only returns *users* using the database. Lets implement *todos* too, create a new file
**/models/Todos.js** and place this code in it
```js
// Import Model class from Objection.js
const { Model } = require("objection");

// Create the Todo model class
class Todo extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return "todos";
  }
}

// Export the Todo to be used in routes
module.exports = Todo;
```

The project is configured with Objection.js and Knex.js; therefore the only thing missing is to update the
**/routes/api/todos.js** file
```js

```

### Testing the endpoints
Visiting the *users* endpoint with Postman, you should see for

**localhost:8080/api/users/**

**localhost:8080/api/todos/**
