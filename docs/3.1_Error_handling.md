# 3.1 Error handling
Error handling is an essential function of our project and is up to us to deal with it. Neither is Objection.js or Knex.js handling any errors.

We have seen in *Chapter 2.4 - Validation* that currently, we handle errors on a case level using a try/catch block. And honestly, we don't handle any errors here; we simply return the error message to the REST API.

But you should never send the errors directly to the client as they may contain SQL and other information that reveals too much about the inner workings of your app.
