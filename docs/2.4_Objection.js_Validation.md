# 2.4 Objection.js Validation
At this stage, the REST API only returns data from the database and is missing the feature to create or update rows.

As soon as you handle user input, you have to validate the data. Objection.js has an in-house validator, the [`jsonSchema()` method](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/model/static-properties.html#static-jsonschema), where you define properties, data types, and additional constraints.

Lets have a look at our User model with such a validator:

**/models/User.js**
```js
const { Model } = require("objection");

class User extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return "users";
  }

  // jsonSchema used for input validation. This is not the database schema!
  static get jsonSchema(){
    return {
      type: 'object',
      required : ['name'],

      properties:{
        id: {type:'integer'},
        name: {type: 'string', minLength:1, maxLength:255},
        age: {type: "number"} //optional
      }
    }
  }
}

module.exports = User;
```
In the code above:
- `jsonSchema()` returns always an object with a key/value pair of `type:'object'` This is a default to Objection.js.
- they key `required` accepts an array of key names that must have a value. A `required` key name needs to exist inside the `properties` key
- `name` and `age` key names have no direct link to the database columns but should have the same name as the column name.
- the key `properties` is used to specify key names and their respective data type (and constraints).
- `type` reflects what data type you expect to receive. Some basic types are `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, ...
The difference between `number` and `integer` is that `34` and `1.82` satisfy `number`, but only `34` satisfies `integer`. A more detailed reference can be found  [here (JSON Schema type Reference)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/index.html).
- `minLength` and `maxLength` are data type-specific constraints and are self-explaining.
- `age` is not part of the required key and the key `type` is only used if a value exists


`jsonSchema()` uses the third party tool [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for validation - so you have to use that one for reference.

### Validate user input
The validator is ready, so let's insert some data and see what happens.

First, we use static data. Later on, will we use data received from a `POST` request.
Let's update our users route

**/routes/api/users.js**
```js
const router = express.Router();

const User = require("../../models/Users");

// get all users
router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.query();
  res.json(users);
});

// Create new user using a POST request
router.post("/", async (req, res) => {

    // wrap in try/catch
    try {
        const user = await User.query().insert({ name: "Kim", age: 28 });
        res.json(user);
    } catch (err) {
        // VERY basic error handler, look in Error handling chapter for better solution
        res.status(400).json(err.data);
    }
});

// Export to api.js
module.exports = router;
```
In the code above:
- wrap the insert method in a try/catch to handle validation.
- `insert()` is the method used to insert data. We're going to talk about the method in detail below.
- `catch(err)` catch if validation or insert errors occur and send an HTTP status 400 Bad Request back. Look in *Chapter 3.1 - Error handling* how errors should be dealt with.

**Testing with Postman**
Visiting **localhost:8080/api/users/** with a POST request displays

A failed validation (E.g., using a number for name - `name: 33`) would have looked like this

### insert() method
Using the `insert` method, the inserted data is validated against the `jsonSchema` method. The promise throws an error if the validation fails. You can either use `try/catch`  or `.then().catch`.

The `insert` method accepts both *objects* and *arrays* (batch insert - for multiple items) **. Still, arrays are only supported if you use a PostgreSQL database** because it is the only database system that returns **all** inserted rows. Sounds familiar? We have already seen the same issue in *Chapter 1.3 - Knex.js Seeds*. 

**Workaround for MySQL and other non-PostgreSQL databases**
We have done batch inserts in *Chapter 1.3 - Knex.js Seeds* using plain Knex.js without Objection.js.
Using `Model.knexQuery()` instead of `Model.query()` allows us to run queries directly through Knex.js (and not Objection.js models). Even with `knexQuery` there is still only one item returned with multiple inserts.
