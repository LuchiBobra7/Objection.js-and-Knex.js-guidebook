# 2.0 Objection.js Setup
Setting up Objection.js is fairly simple. The only requirement you need is to have `knex` alongside a database client, like `mysql` installed and initialized with migrations (and seeds if you want sample data).

Both requirements have been met by following along *Chapter 1*.

What's left is to install objection. Type in your terminal:
```shell
npm install objection
```
