# 0.2 API Endpoints setup
**Express** is the framework we use to create the API endpoints (called routes) and handle requests & responses.

There are two ways to create routes in express using the:
- route methods -> `app.get(...)`
- router class -> `router.get(...)`

The difference between them is that the second option is used to make the routes more maintainable in more significant projects. 

Instead of having all routes inside the main NodeJS file, you can categorize and separate them into their own **mini-app**.

Using the router class, you define in your main NodeJS file some *base endpoints*, which then is extended in more route files.
E.g.
- *www.restaurant.com/food* -> everything food-related will be handled by the `/routes/food.js` file
- *www.restaurant.com/order* -> everything order-related will be handled by the `/routes/order.js` file
- *www.restaurant.com/reservation* -> everything table reservation-related will be handled by the `/routes/reservation.js` file

> **Note:**
> If you know the Python framework called *Django*, then you can think of it as splitting up a project in multiple apps. Each route file, in this case, is an app and has its very own functionality.

Let's have a look at both approaches with hardcoded data.

#### Example using route methods
**/server.js**
```js
// Route Methods
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Create endpoint of all users
app.get("/api/users/", (req, res) => {
  res.json([
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Marc",
      age: 19
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: "Ben",
      age: 31
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      name: "Jessica",
      age: 27
    }
  ]);
});

// Create endpoint of all todos
// Done status: 0 - false ; 1 - true
app.get("/api/todos/", (req, res) => {
  res.json([
    {
      id: 1,
      user_id: 1, // -> Marc
      todo: "Buy Milk",
      done: 0
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      user_id: 1, // -> Marc
      todo: "Walk the dog",
      done: 0
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      user_id: 3, // -> Jessica
      todo: "Call grandma",
      done: 0
    }
  ]);
});

// Start the server
const server = app.listen(8080, error => {
  if (error) {
    console.log("Error running Express");
  }
  console.log("Server is running on port", server.address().port);
});
```
This is the fastest and easy way to create routes.

> **To return or not return**
> `app.get("/", (req,res) => { ... })` does **not** expect a value to be returned. There's no difference with using `return` or not, except using it will add additional overhead.
> Only use `return` if you want to stop the functions execution (e.g. nested if else statements.)

### Router class
Considering that we, later on, create large and complex web applications, we use the router class. 

For this, we have to create new directories and files. 
Create the:
- **/routes/** directory. This directory contains all route files.
- **/routes/api.js** file. This file handles all route files related to the `example.com/api/` endpoint.
- **/routes/api/** directory. This directory contains all API route related files.
- **/routes/api/users.js** file. This file handles all `api/users/` endpoints, which could be getting all users or updating a single one.
- **/routes/api/todos.js** file. This file handles all `api/todos/` endpoints, which could be getting all todos or updating a single one.

After that, we have to update the *server.js* file and remove the logic from it. The only purpose of this file should be to include the route handlers.
**server.js**
```js
// Route Class
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Require router files
const apiRoutes = require("./routes/api");

// Include the routes to express
app.use("/api", apiRoutes);

// Start the server
const server = app.listen(8080, error => {
  if (error) {
    console.log("Error running Express");
  }
  console.log("Server is running on port", server.address().port);
});
```

Next, our */routes/api.js* file should, once again, only combine and include the logic of each endpoint, which separates the */routes/api/users.js* and */routes/api/todos.js* files.

**/routes/api.js**
```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Require router files
const usersRoutes = require("./api/users");
const todosRoutes = require("./api/todos");

// Include the routes to express
app.use("/users", usersRoutes);
app.use("/todos", todosRoutes);

// Export the file to be used in server.js
module.exports = app;
```

**/routes/api/users.js**
```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Create endpoint of all users
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json([
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Marc",
      age: 19
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: "Ben",
      age: 31
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      name: "Jessica",
      age: 27
    }
  ]);
});

// Export to api.js
module.exports = router;
```

**/routes/api/todos.js**
```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Create endpoint of all todos
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json([
    {
      id: 1,
      user_id: 1, // -> Marc
      todo: "Buy Milk",
      done: 0
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      user_id: 1, // -> Marc
      todo: "Walk the dog",
      done: 0
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      user_id: 3, // -> Jessica
      todo: "Call grandma",
      done: 0
    }
  ]);
});

// Export to api.js
module.exports = router;
```

### Testing the endpoints
If you would now visit the endpoints with Postman, you should see for

**localhost:8080/api/users/**

**localhost:8080/api/todos/**
![4Qvuqlw.png](https://i.imgur.com/4Qvuqlw.png)

**Now we should have the underlying REST API setup and are ready to implement the database with Knex.js and Objection.js**

> This setup is an overkill for this small and only REST API project, but hopefully, it is a good base for future projects.
