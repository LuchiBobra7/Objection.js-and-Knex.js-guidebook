# 2.3 Objection.js Relationships
In *Chapter 1.2 - Knex.js migrations*, we defined an OneToMany relationship between the table `users` and `todos` with the help of foreign keys inside `todos`.

While these relationships usually are created between the primary key of one table and a foreign key reference of another table, Objection.js has no such limitations. You can create a relationship using any two columns (or any sets of columns). You can even create relations using values nested deep inside JSON columns.

This is helpful while querying for items from multiple tables (e.g., in a JOIN operation) as we can pre-define relationships and then create non-complex queries using these pre-defined relationships.


> **Reminder**
> Our Objection.js models **are not** the ones creating tables. They only *get/set* data *from/to* the tables. The following sections have nothing to do with defining and creating the database tables.


## relationMappings
The [`relationMappings()`](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/model/static-properties.html#static-relationmappings) [static property](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/model/static-properties.html) defines the relations (relationships, associations) to other models.

Lets look how we would add `relationMappings()` to our Todo class in
**/models/Todo.js**
```js
const { Model } = require("objection");

// Import User class model for relationMappings()
const User = require("./Users.js");

class Todo extends Model{

    class Todo extends Model {
      static get tableName() {
        return "todos";
      }
      
    // defines the relations to other models.
    static get relationMappings() {
          return {
              user: {
                  relation: Model.BelongsToOneRelation,
                  modelClass: User,
                  join: {
                      from: "todos.user_id",
                      to: "users.id"
                  }
            }
        };
    }
}
```
In the syntax above:
- `relationMappings()` always returns an object
- the key `user` is how we will refer to it to the parent class
- the key `relation` has the relationship value `Model.BelongsToOneRelation` which says that each todo has one user.
- the key `modelClass` says that the whole `user` object comes from the `User` class
- the key `join` specifies the database table and column names to perform a SQL `JOIN` operation on, in this case, the `user_id` column in the `todos` table to the `id` column in the `users` table


#### Model.RELATION_TYPE
There are three RELATION_TYPE to choose from

**`Model.BelongsToOneRelation`**
The parent class has one relation to another model. 
Example: The Todo class uses `.BelongsToOneRelation` because a todo only has one assigned user.

**`Model.HasManyRelation`**
The parent class has many relations to another model.
Example: The User class uses `.HasManyRelation` because a user can have many todos)

**`Model.ManyToManyRelation`**
The parent class and another model have many relations with each other.
Example: Currently, neither the User or Todo has a `ManyToManyRelation`, but if it was possible that multiple users could have the same todo task, then we could use the `ManyToManyRelation`.

### Query the relation
Simply because the relation to users has is defined doesn't mean that it's included in the base `.query()` function. You still need to specify that you want to use it. This is achieved by using the `withGraphFetched()` function.

We can see it in action by updating our
**/routes/api/todos.js** file
```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const Todo = require("../../models/Todos.js");

// Create endpoint of all todos
router.get("/", async (req, res) => {

  // Get all todos WITH the assigned user
  const todos = await Todo.query().withGraphFetched("user");
  res.json(todos);
});

// Export to api.js
module.exports = router;
```
Here, the text `user` inside `.withGraphFetched` refers to our **custom key** in the Todo class `relationMappings()` and not to the users database table.

**Testing** the updated query in Postman shows

### Why use this approach?
You might already have inspected Objection.js and Knex.js documentation and figured out that there is also a [`.join()` method](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/join-methods.html#join), which for our case would look like
```js
// Get all todos WITH the assigned user
  const todos = await Todo.query()
    .select("*")
    .rightJoin("users", "todos.user_id", "=", "users.id");

  res.json(todos);
```
with the SQL equivalent 
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM todos
RIGHT JOIN users 
ON todos.user_id = users.id;
```

Both approaches are totally valid, but when you create relation mappings to model (using `relationMappings()`), you don't have to write joins manually every time you need to query relations. Also, they enable many other objection features, which require information about how row relations goes in DB.


### Eager loading
The whole above process is called **eager loading**.
Eager loading is the process whereby a query for one type of entity also loads related entities as part of the query.

For example, when querying todos, eager-load their users. The todos and their users are retrieved in a single query.

Multiple methods can be used to load relations eagerly: `.withGraphFetched()` (the one we have just seen) and `.withGraphJoined()`. The main difference is that `.withGraphFetched()` uses multiple queries under the hood to fetch the result while `.withGraphJoined()` uses a single query and joins to fetch the results. Both methods allow you to do different things which we will go through in detail in the examples below and the examples of the `.withGraphJoined()` method.

Even though `.withGraphJoined()` sounds more performant, but that is not always true. 90% of the times you want to use `.withGraphFetched()`.

**Why tell you this?** 
You'll likely find online resources on Objection.js `relationMappings()` and eager loading where they use the [`.eager()`](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#eager) method. However, this method is deprecated, and you should use `.withGraphFetched()`.
