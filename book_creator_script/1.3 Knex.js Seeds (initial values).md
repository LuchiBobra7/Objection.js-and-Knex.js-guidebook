# 1.3 Knex.js Seeds (initial values)
Seeding means setting the database tables with sample data to get a new development environment up and running. Knex makes it easy to seed a database. We seed our users and todos table with some initial values.

## Creating Seed files
You can instruct Knex to create new seed scripts using the following command in your terminal

```shell
knex seed:make 001_create_data
```

You will see a newly created directory and file **/seeds/001_create_data.js** with a boilerplate.

> **Note**
> Unlike migrations, seeds don't have a timestamp. Your seed name should, therefore, be something descriptive and start with a version number, e.g., `001_`, `002_`. Seed files are executed sequentially (one after another) if used with a version number.
> 
> Remember that throughout the lifetime of your app, there may be several seeds that all relate to the same database table, so you want your seeds names to inform other developers the version and action it does.
> 

Lets edit the seed file to our needs
**/seeds/001_create_data.js**
```js
exports.seed = function(knex) {
  // Deletes ALL data of todos
  return knex("todos")
    .del()
    .then(() => {
      //Delete ALL data of users
      return knex("users").del();
    })
    .then(() => {
      //Inserts new data into users
      return knex("users").insert([
        {
          name: "Marc",
          age: 19
        },
        {
          name: "Ben",
          age: 31
        },
        {
          name: "Jessica",
          age: 27
        }
      ]);
    })
    .then(users => {
      /**
       * We can use the callback of the previous users inserts,
       * which returns a single item or an array of items (array only available in PostgreSQL), to
       * insert todos data and establish the relationship with users.
       */
      return knex("todos").insert([
        {
          user_id: 1, //-> Marc
          // alternatively to the fixed value one, you can also use
          // user_id: users[0]
          todo: "Buy Milk"
        },
        {
          user_id: 1, //-> Marc
          todo: "Walk the dog"
        },
        {
          user_id: 2, //-> Jessica
          todo: "Call grandma"
        }
      ]);
    });
};

```
**Explanation:**
You notice that the seed file starts by deleting any rows in the database. This is so that we can ensure weâ€™re starting with a clean slate any time we run our seed file.

Because we are working with users and todos, we need to clear out both tables (todos first, as they depend on users existing).

Knex.js nature is promise based and expects a callback. The same goes for seeding data to the database.
We not only perform one task but multiple ones. Chaining multiple tasks with a `.then( ()=>{ ... } )` method allows us to perform multiple tasks one after another. 

`.insert()`, `.del()` and many other Knex.js methods return a callback with a single or multiple items (multiple items, except get queries,  are only available in Postgress) which then can be used in the following chained `.then()` method.

## Apply seeds
To apply the seed data to your database tables, type in your terminal
```shell
knex seed:run
```

## Seeds issue
Running seeds inserts new rows in the tables. These tables have an *auto increment* id attribute. Each time new rows are added, the id is increased to a new +1 value.

The above seed file only works once, when no data has ever been added to the table before!

Trying to re-run those seeds (i.e., delete all data and re-insert), they will fail because the users ids starts at 4 after we inserted the data the first time. The hard coded users id 1 and 3 in line 38, 44, and 48 do not exist anymore.

And no, there is no logic build in rollback command as we know it for migrations.

Two solutions to this issues are shown below.

#### Solution A:
Doing a full reset, which includes:
1. `knex migrate:rollback` -> delete table
2. `knex migrate:latest` -> create table

makes sure that the tables *auto increment* value for the ids start again at 1.

Now you could run the seed without issues **one time** again.

Using this method, you have to redo a full reset every time you want to add new data to tables.

#### Solution B:
If it doesn't matter to use only one users id for all todos, then you can make use of the callback in line 26, which always returns the id of the first inserted user in the users table.

Here would then be the updated seeds file:
**/seeds/001_create_data.js**
```js
exports.seed = function(knex) {
  // Deletes ALL data of todos
  return knex("todos")
    .del()
    .then(() => {
      //Delete ALL data of users
      return knex("users").del();
    })
    .then(() => {
      //Inserts new data into users
      return knex("users").insert([
        {
          name: "Marc",
          age: 19
        },
        {
          name: "Ben",
          age: 31
        },
        {
          name: "Jessica",
          age: 27
        }
      ]);
    })
    .then(users => {
      console.log(JSON.stringify(users, null, 4));
      /**
       * We can use the callback of the previous users inserts,
       * which returns a single item or an array of items (array only available in PostgressSQL), to
       * insert todos data and establish the relationship to users.
       */
      return knex("todos").insert([
        {
          user_id: users[0], //-> Marc
          todo: "Buy Milk"
        },
        {
          user_id: users[0], //-> Marc
          todo: "Walk the dog"
        },
        {
          user_id: users[0], //-> Marc
          todo: "Call grandma"
        }
      ]);
    });
};
```
Because of database system natures, PostgreSQL is the only database which returns **all** inserted items. MySQL and the others can only return the first item.
